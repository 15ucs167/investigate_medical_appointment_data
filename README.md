Introduction

In this project, I'm investigating a dataset that contains around 100,000 records of medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset has 'No-show' as the dependent variable which tells whether a patient fulfilled his/her appointment or not.

I'm interested in exploring:

Q1. How do the different genders fair when it comes to fulfilling appointments?

Q2. Which neighbourhoods have the highest no-show proportions?

Q3. How do different age groups perform in fulfilling medical appointments?


Conclusions

About 80% of the people of both genders showed-up for their appointments whereas about 20% didn't.

Neighbourhoods with the highest proportions of no-shows are:

(a) Ilhas Oceanicas de Trindade

(b) Santos Dumont

(c) Santa Cecilia

(d) Santa Clara

(e) Itarare

Young Adults (18-37 years) had maximum no-shows while Seniors (55+ years) had the least
